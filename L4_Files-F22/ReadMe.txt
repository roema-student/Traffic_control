This is a program creating a scene as a bridge in Kingston, Canada is under construction.
In order to maintain a efficient and doable traffic control, I wrote this traffic light control system,
comes with a car system play a role as the driver in the car.
Under this circumstances, only one lane of the road is available but we have two ways of traffic,
so that the traffic light may deal with this using mutex locks in java.
